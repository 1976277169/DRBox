# DRBox
I'm working hard to make my code more clear and readable. I will upload them not later than one week.
DRBox, detector using rotatable bounding box, is a deep learning based algorithm to detect vehicles, ships and airplanes in remote sensing images. I'm also looking forward to its use in other problems.
